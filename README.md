One Campus AI
Extended Description

One Campus AI is a unified AI-powered platform designed to simplify and modernize campus operations. Many college campuses operate through fragmented and manual systems for reporting complaints, identifying phishing threats, and handling lost-and-found items. This often leads to delays, confusion, and security risks for students.

Our platform centralizes these essential services into one intelligent interface that leverages artificial intelligence to automate decision-making and streamline communication between students and administrators.

Problem Statement

Students frequently encounter:

Suspicious emails related to scholarships, internships, or placements

Difficulty reporting complaints to the correct department

Inefficient lost-and-found systems

Delayed administrative response

Traditional systems lack automation and intelligent categorization, resulting in miscommunication and reduced campus efficiency.

Proposed Solution

One Campus AI integrates three core AI-driven modules:

1. AI Phishing Detector

Students can paste suspicious emails into the system.
The AI analyzes:

Suspicious wording

Fake links

Urgency patterns

The system generates a risk score and provides an explanation of why the email may be fraudulent.

2. Smart Complaint Router

Students describe their complaint in natural language.
The AI automatically:

Categorizes it (Hostel, Mess, Academic, Transport, etc.)

Assigns a priority level

Routes it to the appropriate authority

This reduces administrative delays and ensures proper handling.

3. AI Lost & Found System

Students can upload details of lost or found items.
The system identifies and matches entries to help reconnect students with their belongings more efficiently.
